# honeypot-notebook
python based honeypot for intrusion detection and logging in controlled virtual environment.
more importantly, this notebook is only for educational purposes.

# experiment-setup
two virtual machines will be requiring to perform stimulations.

you can use ubuntu or centOS or any lightweight linux OS as a honeypot environment
and, kali linux will be using to perform attacks to honeypot. 
Additionally, plase ensure your testing environment is isolated to prevent unintended consequences.

the services and types of attacks to simulate:
Brute force login, SQL injection, directory traversal, or command injection.
Logs generated for each attack.
Response time or accuracy of logged data.

all you need to do is to download the honeypot.py and run it in your honeypot host virtual machine
and, try perfoming attacks from kali linux using different tools. 

all the log data will be stored in honeypot.log in the same directory as honeypot.py. 

thanks :)
